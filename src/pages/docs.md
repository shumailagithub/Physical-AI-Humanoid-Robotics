📘 Constitution Document for the Book: “Physical AI”
1. Vision

To empower beginners and intermediate learners to understand, build, and experiment with Physical AI systems—AI that interacts with the real world through sensors, actuators, robotics, microcontrollers, and intelligent environments.
The book aims to become the practical learning gateway for anyone wanting to combine AI with physical systems using a hands-on, project-based approach delivered through a modern documentation platform (Docusaurus).

2. Core Principles
1. Hands-On First, Theory Second

Learners understand concepts best when they build first.
Every chapter introduces a concept through a mini-project or real-world example.

2. Beginner-Friendly, Without Oversimplifying

Language must be accessible but never childish.
We simplify concepts without removing their real meaning.

3. Modular & Incremental Learning

Each concept builds on the previous one:

Sensors → microcontrollers → data collection → models → automation → robotics → physical AI systems.

4. Real-World Applications Over Abstract Ideas

Show how Physical AI is used in real life:

Smart homes

Tiny robots

Automation

Wearables

Human-AI physical interactions

5. Open, Extensible, and Community-Driven

Encourage learners to:

Fork and modify examples

Share projects

Build together
Using Docusaurus as the collaborative documentation platform.

6. Transparency and Ethics

Teach safe design, privacy awareness, and responsible automation.

3. Success Criteria

The book is considered successful if:

User-Level Success

Beginners can build at least 5 fully working Physical AI mini projects using the book.

Readers can deploy a working AI-powered physical system (robot, automation, wearable, or IoT tool).

Readers feel confident exploring more advanced physical AI topics independently.

Documentation-Level Success

Docusaurus site loads fast, is searchable, and easy to navigate.

Tutorials include videos, visuals, and interactive code blocks.

Code examples run with minimal setup.

Community-Level Success

People contribute fixes or improvements via GitHub.

At least one open-source mini-project emerges from the book.

Technical Success

All examples work on common hardware (ESP32, Raspberry Pi, Arduino, smartphones with sensors).

All AI models can run on-device or via simple APIs.

4. Constraints
1. Accessibility

Must support learners who:

Have limited hardware

Have slow internet

Are new to programming

2. Open-Source & Low-Cost Tools

Focus on:

Free Python libraries

Free AI models or small on-device models

Affordable hardware (ESP32 > Raspberry Pi > Arduino)

3. Docusaurus Framework

All content must fit within:

Markdown-first workflows

Sidebar navigation system

Versioning & internationalization if needed

4. No Heavy Dependencies

Avoid unnecessary libraries, complex setups, or paid services.

5. Time-to-Value

Every chapter must show results within 5 minutes or less.

5. Stakeholders
Primary Stakeholders

Students and Learners
Beginners exploring AI + hardware.

Self-taught Programmers

Makers, Tinkerers, Hobbyists

Teachers and Educators using the book in class.

Secondary Stakeholders

Open-source contributors

Hardware communities (Arduino, ESP, Raspberry Pi)

AI enthusiasts wanting to expand into robotics

Schools, coding clubs, and bootcamps

6. Brand Voice
Tone

Friendly

Motivating

Beginner-friendly

Curious

Encouraging experimentation

Never arrogant or overly academic

Style

Use simple but clear explanations.

Use practical examples before theory.

Speak directly to the reader (“Let’s build it”).

Maintain a maker/hacker spirit of curiosity.

Use visuals, diagrams, short code blocks.

Messaging Pillars

You can build Physical AI.

Start small. Improve quickly.

Learn by doing.

Every experiment counts.

AI belongs in the real world, not just in code.
