Welcome to the **Physical-AI Book**, where we bridge physics and artificial intelligence through hands-on projects and real-world applications. This book follows the principles outlined in our constitution, focusing on hands-on learning where every concept is introduced through a mini-project or real-world example.

## About This Book

This book is designed to empower beginners and intermediate learners to understand, build, and experiment with Physical AI systems - AI that interacts with the real world through sensors, actuators, robotics, and intelligent environments.

### What You'll Learn:
- How to connect AI with physical systems
- Sensor integration and data collection
- Pattern recognition in sensor data
- Intelligent automation systems
- Building responsive physical AI applications

### Core Principle: Learn by Doing

We believe you understand concepts best when you build first. Each chapter introduces concepts through practical projects that deliver results within minutes, not hours.

## Getting Started

To get started with this book, you'll need:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 20.0 or above
- Hardware components as specified in each chapter (most projects use affordable components like ESP32, Arduino, or Raspberry Pi)
- A computer with internet access for development and package management
- Basic programming knowledge (though we'll explain concepts clearly)

Each project in this book is designed to show results quickly - typically within 5 minutes or less - so you can experience the satisfaction of building Physical AI systems from the beginning.
